🔥 Forest Fire Prediction using Regression Models
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict forest fire occurrences using multiple regression techniques based on key environmental factors such as temperature, FFMC, FWI, and others. The model is built using the Algerian Forest Fire dataset and includes a Flask-based web interface for user interaction.

🚀 Features
✔ Data Preprocessing – Cleaning and handling missing values
✔ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Understanding patterns and correlations
✔ Feature Engineering – Selecting relevant features for better prediction
✔ Regression Models Implemented:

Linear Regression

Lasso Regression

Ridge Regression

Elastic Net Regression
✔ Web Interface – A Flask-based frontend with an HTML form for user input

📂 Technologies Used
🔹 Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
🔹 Flask (for the web interface)
🔹 HTML, CSS (for UI)

📊 How It Works
1️⃣ Input environmental factors like temperature, FFMC, FWI, etc., via the web form.
2️⃣ The model processes the input and predicts the likelihood of a forest fire.
3️⃣ Results are displayed on the web interface.
